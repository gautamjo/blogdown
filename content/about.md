Hello there! Welcome to my little blog! My name is Gautam Joshi. I am a copywriter, autodidact programmer and an aspiring data scientist. These skills allow me to express myself, solve problems and tell stories as best as I can. I am a progressive and proactive person who believes in the concept of lifelong learning. This self motivation and positive outlook keeps me ever curious about seeking for answers. On this blog you will find projects that I have mostly attempted for pleasure and practice. I hope you will find them worth your time.
